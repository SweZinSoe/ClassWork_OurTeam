        The built-in Android Studio migration might not handle everything.
        Depending on your build configuration you may need to update your build scripts
        and Proguard mappings manually. For example, if you maintain your dependency
        configuration in a separate build file, use the mapping files mentioned
        below to review and update your dependencies to the corresponding AndroidX packages.

        \n\nBefore you migrate, bring your app up to date. We recommend updating your project
        to use the final version of the support library: version 28.0.0. This is because AndroidX
        artifacts with version 1.0.0 are binary equivalent to the Support Library 28.0.0 artifacts.
